# zim2web

## What
Generate site from zim-wiki notebook repo.

## Why
I've got a lot of zim notebooks, and kept as repos on GitHub/GitLab.
This really makes it difficult to view them, in the browswer itself.
Trying to ease that.

## How
Setup github pages for the repo.
Specify the site generation skeleton.
Generate a static site for every push, to the repo.

## Alternatives
Zim does have templates, but they are either boring or lack customization options.
